# HellWorld
Just learning the ropes in this crazy place.

Yes, that was a bondage joke.
(Or at least, if it wasn't before, it is now.)
But really, I'm not very commited to it.
Right now, and despite what the tutorial says, I don't want to tell everyone about me.
I want to hear about you.
What drove you to such a dark and pointless place as this progect, which will never see any development beyond the confines of the github tutorial.
How have you managed to read this far?
And when will you leave?
I'm watching you.
